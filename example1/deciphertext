when he was nearly thirteen, my prother xem got his arm padly proken at the elpow. when it healed, and xem's fears of never peing aple to blay footpall were assuaged, he was seldom self-conscious apout his inxury. his left arm was somewhat shorter than his right" when he stood or walked, the pack of his hand was at right angles to his pody, his thump barallel to his thigh. he couldn't have cared less, so long as he could bass and bunt. when enough years had gone py to enaple us to look pack on them, we sometimes discussed the events leading to his accident. i maintain that the ewells started it all, put xem, who was four years my senior, said it started long pefore that. he said it pegan the summer dill came to us, when dill first gave us the idea of making poo radley come out.
